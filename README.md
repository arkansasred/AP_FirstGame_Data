# AP_Game_Data
data from first game/R code for processing.
'readConditions.R' actually reads the scores and makes a plot by condition, and 'readTrajectories.R' calculates the absoulte value of the deviation of the player from the correct base that the enemy is attacking before the enemy is killed.  This measures the extent to which the player is anticipating the aliens based on the sound.

further subject data from second experiment to be added to this
